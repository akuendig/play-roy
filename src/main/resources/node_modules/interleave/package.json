  "readme": "# Interleave\n\nInterleave is a web construction tool that is designed to help developers build well structured libraries and also web applications.  The current (`0.5.x`) development branch is a complete ground-up rewrite of the library which uses a variety of other packages to help make the magic happen.\n\n<a href=\"http://travis-ci.org/#!/DamonOehlman/interleave\"><img src=\"https://secure.travis-ci.org/DamonOehlman/interleave.png\" alt=\"Build Status\"></a>\n\n## Installation\n\nIf you are looking to use the latest version of Interleave, simply run the following command:\n\n```\n[sudo] npm install -g interleave\n```\n\nIf you have been using Interleave 0.3.x (or possibly 0.4.x) then you should install that particular version:\n\n```\n[sudo] npm install -g interleave@0.3.x\n```\n\n## Why Interleave Exists\n\nThe reason that Interleave (and underlying include engine [Rigger](https://github.com/DamonOehlman/rigger)) exists that I believe that our current techniques for building JS libraries, and also rich web applications are not going to see us too many more years into the future.\n\nWe need to place effort and emphasis on creating JS components that are usable both in the browser and in server environments (such as [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) and [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/)).\n\nThere have been some excellent attempts to make this work from the NodeJS side up (see tools like [Browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify)) but client-side libraries still largely use fairly primitive file concatenation as the basis for library builds.\n\nI started Interleave some time ago, taking inspiration from [Sprockets](https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets) and finally, after many months of development on it and [components of the solution stack](/DamonOehlman/interleave/wiki/Solution-Stack), Interleave is starting to really come together.\n\n## How To Use Interleave\n\nInterleave is designed to be used primarily as a command-line tool in it's own right, but can also be integrated with build tools like [Jake](/mde/Jake) using a [simple API](/DamonOehlman/interleave/wiki/API).\n\nWhen using a tool like Interleave it's a good idea to create a `src/` directory (or similar) in which your raw source files will be created. Personally, I find it works really well to put whichever files you wish to create a distribution for in this `src/` folder and then place other sources that will be \"rigged\" in within subdirectories within the `src/`.\n\nThe following is one example of how a project using Interleave could be structured:\n\n    - src/\n      |- core/\n         |- a.js\n         |- b.coffee\n      |- mylibrary.js\n    - README.md\n    \nThe contents of `src/mylibrary.js` would look something like:\n\n```js\n//= core/a\n//= core/b.coffee\n```\n    \nYou could then build your library / app using the following command:\n\n```\ninterleave build src/*.js\n```\n\nIn fact, as Interleave is built with \"convention over configuration\" in mind, you can actually run just `interleave build` and Interleave will imply that you want to build all `.js` files within the `src/` folder.\n\nOnce the `interleave` command has finished, a `dist/` folder (by default) will be created and your generated `mylibrary.js` file will exist in that folder.\n\nFor this and more examples, see the [examples](/DamonOehlman/interleave/tree/master/examples) folder of this repo.\n\n## Packaging for AMD, CommonJS and the Browser\n\nBy default, Interleave will take your input files, rig in specified includes and spit out the combined result in a `dist` folder.  If you are building a library that you want to work on multiple platforms (AMD, CommonJS, etc) then consider using the `--wrap` option to generate packages tailored for each of the platforms.\n\nFor instance, the following command would take `.js` files in the `src/` folder and generate `amd`, `commonjs` and `glob` variants in the `dist/` folder:\n\n```\ninterleave build src/*.js --wrap\n```\n\nIn the case that you only want specific platform variants (e.g. AMD) specify a comma-delimited list for the `--wrap` option:\n\n```\ninterleave build src/*.js --wrap glob,amd\n```\n\nIn cases where you are writing a dependency-free library (which [isn't something that should always be encouraged](/DamonOehlman/damonoehlman.github.com/issues/5)) then you can simply write your library source incorporating one of the [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) patterns and generate a single file.\n\n## CoffeeScript, Stylus and Friends are Treated Well\n\nIf you use [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/), [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/) or other precompilers these are well treated by Interleave (courtesy of [Rigger](/DamonOehlman/rigger)).  Unlike the core Rigger engine though, Interleave will assume that you want to convert source `.coffee`, `.styl`, etc files into their web consumable equivalents (i.e. `.js`, `.css`, etc). \n\n## Other Command Line Options\n\nThe following command line options are supported by Interleave. \n\n### Common Command Line Opts\n\n    --version\n    \nPrint the Interleave version\n    \n    --help\n    \nPrint a list of commands supported by Interleave\n    \n    --help [command]\n    \nPrint the information related to [command]\n\n__NOTE:__ Help commands are still to be implemented in scaffolder (see: DamonOehlman/scaffolder#3)\n\n### `build` Command Options\n\n    --output [path]     \n    \nThe directory in which output files will be generated. (default: dist/)\n    \n    --wrap [platformTypes]\n    \nUsed to tell Interleave to wrap distributions for particular types of platforms. (default: amd,commonjs,glob)\n    \n    --watch\n    \nUsed to tell Interleave to watch any source files for changes.  When a change has been detected, the output files will be automatically regenerated.  __NOTE:__ This has not yet been implemented (see #15).",
